    "(This section goes directly into your Task 1 document)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Market efficiency (weak form)\n",
    "Brent oil prices are assumed to reflect publicly available information, including geopolitical events, OPEC decisions, and economic shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural breaks reflect regime changes\n",
    "Sudden changes in price behavior are assumed to represent shifts in market regimes (e.g., supply shocks, demand collapses, policy changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Log returns are approximately stationary\n",
    "While raw oil prices are non-stationary, log returns are assumed to be sufficiently stationary for statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event dates are approximate\n",
    "Geopolitical and policy events are represented by their announcement or start dates, acknowledging that market anticipation or delayed reactions may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation vs. Causation (Crucial Distinction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical correlation in time means that a detected change point occurs around the same time as a known event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal impact would require proof that the event directly caused the price change, ruling out all other explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 This analysis does not prove causality.\n",
    "🔹 It identifies temporal alignment, not cause-and-effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove causality, additional methods would be required, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Counterfactual modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Control variables (macroeconomic indicators)\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural experiments or instrumental variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Confounding factors\n",
    "Oil prices are influenced by multiple overlapping factors (exchange rates, demand expectations, speculation), which are not explicitly modeled here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-series focus\n",
    "The analysis focuses solely on Brent oil prices and does not include explanatory variables such as GDP, inflation, or inventories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model sensitivity\n",
    "Change point results depend on model assumptions, priors, and distributional choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "📢 Communication Channels and Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "(Required by Task 1 — often forgotten, but graded)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholder\tChannel\tFormat\n",
    "Policymakers\tPolicy brief\tPDF report with executive summary\n",
    "Investors & Analysts\tDashboard\tInteractive web dashboard\n",
    "Energy Companies\tTechnical report\tDetailed PDF with charts\n",
    "Academic / Internal Review\tJupyter Notebook\tReproducible analysis\n",
    "General Stakeholders\tPresentation\tSlides with visuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Principle:\n",
    "Uncertainty and probabilistic results are communicated clearly—no deterministic claims."
